- Click **Add Data Files** to load any number of files (to simulate ingesting data) and then click **Process Data** button to start...
- The main clusters—**Domain Names** and **Online Personas**—pulsating, overlay the discovered subclusters.
- To minimize the pulsating main clusters, click **'Hide Main Clusters'** at the top left.
- First, click on any subcluster to fan out its nodes.
- Drag the clicked subcluster node to reposition it as needed.
- **Single-click** on any fanned-out node to reveal its interconnections (the clicked node will turn yellow, and its adjacent nodes will turn orange).
- **Double-click** on any fanned-out node to remove it.
- **Double-click** on a subcluster node to restore its removed/hidden nodes.
- **Single-click** to reset and snap back a subcluster and all its nodes to their original positions.
- Node details and interconnections are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
- To test classification, type a domain name into the **"Enter Domain Name"** field. Any identified domain will momentarily turn yellow.
- To ingest and classify additional data, select a series of files and click **'Process Data'**. Any clustered domain or persona found will briefly turn yellow.
